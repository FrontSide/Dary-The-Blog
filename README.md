# Dary-The-Blog

A Blogging Web-App written in Java using the Framework Play.

## Dependencies

Some vendors are not included in the git repository.
Add the following libraries and third-party plugins in order to successfully run the App.

- [markdown-js] (https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js)
  This is the Markdown-to-HTML converter library.
  Copy the **markdown.min.js** file into the **/public/vendors/markdown/addons** folder.

  Dary uses the [bootstrap-markdown] (http://toopay.github.io/bootstrap-markdown/) editor, however,
  it (and some of its dependencies) are included via CDNs.

- ~~[Polymer] (http://www.polymer-project.org)
  This is a Google UI-Element Library. 
  Install its core- and paper-elements into the **/public/vendors/polymer** folder 
  preferably by using Twitter's package manager **Bower*~~ 


## Technologies
